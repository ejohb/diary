<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you don't want an introduction and just want to read the diaries,</p>

<p>But for some additional context, see below.</p>

<h2>What is This?</h2>

These are the dairies, written while a prisoner of war, of Robert Brown (or likely, if you're reading this, <i>our
    father</i>).

<h2>Archive and Website</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of this project was to create an archive, as opposed to a website:
    i.e. simply to preserve, and transcribe the original material before the natural effects of aging etc. left too much
    of it unreadable and hence lost forever.</p>

<p>The result was a basic collection of high-quality scans of the original document and associated transcribed
    texts.</p>

<p>This website, on the other hand, is a layer on top of that archive, that allows it to be read in a convenient way.
    In other words, it uses the archive as assets, but additionally pairs together the scans with their corresponding
    transcriptions on the same page, adds navigation controls to allow a natural reading order, includes additional
    metadata regarding interesting concepts in hover-over links, etc.</p>

<p>Note: because the scans on this site are drawn directly from the archive, they are extremely high-resolution, meaning
    they may take longer to load than those on a typical website.</p>

<h2>Transcriptions</h2>

<p>The vast majority of the text has been transcribed with a reasonable degree of confidence. However, some leaves have
    suffered significantly from wear, mould and, worse, water. Further, one folio (number 9) is missing entirely; since
    it would have been between two other water-damaged folios, it is possible that R.B. deemed it
    irrecoverably damaged and unfortunately discarded it.</p>

<p>Anyway, illegible words are currently marked with <span class="control">WORD</span>. It's quite possible that with
    more time, image processing, or simply eyes, these sections can be further deciphered.</p>
