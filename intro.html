<h2>Background</h2>

This is the diary, written while a prisoner of war, of Robert Brown (or likely, if you're reading this, <i>our
    father</i>).

<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>NAME: ROBERT BENJAMIN BROWN 26/01/1920-2000.</p>
<p>SERVICE NUMBER: 997977</p>
<p>ARM: ROYAL ARTILLERY. Initially 175 Field Artillery Regiment. (?)</p>
<p>RANK: A/Lance-Bombardier. Volunteered for the Royal Artillery in 1940.</p>
<p>SERVICE: Iraq, Western Desert.</p>
<p>Possibly 7th Indian Brigade, 4th Indian Division. 1st, 4th, 11th, 25th, 31st and 32nd Field Regiments, RA.</p>
<p>POW: No 31704. Listed in the German & Occupied Territories British Army Imperial Prisoners of War List.</p>
<p>2/6/1942 - Captured by Italian forces possibly during Rommel's second offensive against Tobruk, whilst in convoy in
    the Western Desert. Apparently the first they realised it was when an Italian soldier shoved a Tommy gun through the
    window of their transport!</p>
<p>Camps: Tobruk, Caserta Hospital, Nocera Military Hospital, Stalag 344 Germany.</p>
<p>RB had stomach issues (dysentery) and was hospitalised for certain periods. He once stated he preferred the hospital
    as you actually had meat rations, he remembered he once had a steak that was almost as thin as paper! <b>Stalag
        VIII-B</b>
    was a German Army prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, later renumbered <b>Stalag-344</b>, located near the
    village of
    Lamsdorf (now Łambinowice) in Silesia. In early 1945 the camp was evacuated due to the advancing Russians. RB may
    have been on one of the many - now infamous - long marches of prisoners towards the west, through the terrible
    conditions of the 1945 winter months. Eventually liberated when an Allied tank drove through the gates of his
    current POW camp in April 1945.</p>


<h3>Contemporary Experiences</h3>
<p>Here's a short passage from a fellow gunner who was in the same POW camp as RB, as quite eloquently expresses the
    hardships of POW life.</p>


<blockquote>
    <figure>
        <p>Captivity in life is something that very few could adequately describe. You have to feel it. You have to
            live with it and you have to know just what it means to appreciate what a mental strain captivity is. We
            experienced
            through our incarceration many physical handicaps but none were so hard to bear as the mental ones. The
            monotony of
            the life and its apparent endlessness practically drove you mad. You yearned for a change; you yearned for
            something
            different; you yearned for female company; you yearned for the company of your loved ones; and you yearned
            for home.
            As the months passed uneventfully, it became fairly obvious that we should in time become utterly fed up
            with one
            another's company. Week after week, month after month, year after year, the same old faces, the same
            mannerisms, the
            same conversations. All this played on one's nerves and one felt that one would go mad. 1 was desperate
            sometimes
            and as I gazed out of the window there was nothing to see but barbed wire. There were no prospects in the
            immediate
            future; one could see no end to the war and no end to our own captivity. What was the remedy? Just to stick
            it out,
            have a sleep and try to dispel all thoughts from one's mind. There was no other way. It was that or
            insanity.</p>

<h2>Archive and Website</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of this project was to create an archive, as opposed to a website:
    i.e. simply to preserve, and transcribe the original material before the natural effects of aging etc. left too much
    of it unreadable and hence lost forever.</p>

<p>The result was a basic collection of high-quality scans of the original document and associated transcribed
    texts.</p>

<p>This website, on the other hand, is a layer on top of that archive, that allows it to be read in a convenient way.
    In other words, it uses the archive as assets, but additionally pairs together the scans with their corresponding
    transcriptions on the same page and in a natural reading order, includes additional metadata regarding interesting
    concepts in hover-over links, etc.</p>

<p>Note: because the scans on this site are drawn directly from the archive, they are extremely high-resolution, meaning
    they may take longer to load than those on a typical website.</p>

<h2>Transcriptions</h2>

<p>The vast majority of the text has been transcribed with a reasonable degree of confidence. However, some leaves have
    suffered significantly from wear, mould and, worse, water. Further, one folio (number 9) is missing entirely; since
    it would have been between two other water-damaged folios, it is possible that RB deemed it
    irrecoverably damaged and unfortunately discarded it.</p>

<p>Anyway, illegible words are currently marked with <span class="control">WORD</span>. It's quite possible that with
    more time, image processing, or simply eyes, these sections can be further deciphered.</p>
