A great variety of articles are exchanged for bread, jam, marmalade + cigarettes, chiefly.
A watch (costing say  <span class="tooltip">30/-<span

Gold watches + diamond rings may bring 2 loaves, 2 tins of jam + 40 cigarettes.
£1 (Egyptian) used to bring 20 cigarettes but may now bring as many as 40 or 50.

The German is better to deal with.
He brings bigger loaves + tins of jam.
I heard of a £30 camera being swapped for 4 loaves, about 4 tins of jam, 50 cigs + I think 200 Lire yesterday.
With rumours of us being moved in the near future, swapping has had a big fillip.
