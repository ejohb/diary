I must not go to the <span class="control">WORD</span> <span class="control">WORD</span>

<br/><span class="date">Wednesday, September 16<sup>th</sup></span> Has been
unpleasantly windy today and not
conducive to being very active. We
had a hot meal again today.  Though
it was only pea soup it tasted very
good. I know I feel more hungry
again now on the shorter rations.
Spend an interesting hour at the
"Quiet Time" sharing this morning. These
really are helpful and I've learnt quite
a bit from hearing what other people
have thought about and pray for. Some
of the things may seem a little petty
but of course all things are important
so far as out relations with others are
concerned. Still I'd like to see some thoughts
on the big questions of life though I'm
very vague about this myself.
The R.A.F. came over and bombed the
town at about 1 o'clock seemingly taking
everyone by surprise.

Had a talk with Errol Phipson this
morning about religious matters chiefly
talked about ways of living and of
sin.
