... the day, but not so many as when we first came here.
The harbour is be1hind the "cathedral" and to the left of it (Bearing about ℒ70° from us) and we can see the smoke of the ships when they are getting up steam. The camp itself is divided into 3, each in charge of an R.S.M.
We have little Italian tents - one between 3. They give us shade during the day but I shouldn't put too much faith in them in an English thunderstorm or an Iraqi dust-storm. Lice seem to be getting pretty bad here but we have a mobile disinfecting oven in the camp. The showers are a boon too but it's a pity we can't get any soap. The Italian camp commandant says they are pretty badly off for it themselves.
