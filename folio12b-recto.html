The dominant note of the service
depended on the fact that a goodly
number of the congregation did not
bother about church and have found
comfort in prayer and faith during
their adversity. <span class="tooltip">The text (John 16xvi) says
"Ye have not chosen me but I have
chosen you"<span class="tooltip-text">The verse in question is actually <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15&version=KJV">John 15</a>xvi, not <a
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16&version=KJV">John 16</a>xvi.</span></span> and the sermon dwelt on
everyone's uniqueness in life (in
character + in everything we do), &
our aim + purpose as part of God's
plan (which made me prick up my
ears but was not dwelt on for long).
The service reminded me of Mum + Dad
going to church on the Nation Day
of Prayer at the time of Dunkirk
when the minister scolded them, we
the congregation, for coming to Church
only in times of need.
We have heard from some fresh
prisoners that Sevastopol and Rostov
are in German hands. I wonder just
how serious this is + deeply regret
having neglected to really discover
the importance of each international
and political event.
