It was Doug's 20th birthday
on Sunday. I suppose he will
be a very different chap when
I see him again which pray God
won't be in the too
far distant future. Here's wishing
him many very happy returns of
the day. If I remember rightly,
Ruth is 24 today. It seems
quite a great age! I hope she
sees many more birthdays, too.
