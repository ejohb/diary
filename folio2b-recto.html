I did intend to write on Sunday but
just didn't "get around to it" as the
youths might say. Monday & Tuesday
I felt not too good having a cold.
The <span class="tooltip">M.O.<span class="tooltip-text">Medical Officer.</span></span> gave me 2 tablets which gave
me some pretty awful pains but helped
a lot I think to clear away the cold.
Anyway, I'm alright again now, thanks

a bit of trouble in keeping hands off
my rations until the time I originally
intended to eat them. It seems to depend
mainly on the frame of mind into
which I put myself when I first
get them.
