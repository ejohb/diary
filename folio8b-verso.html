            class="tooltip-text">John 3:iii</span></span>" Such was the text
for the sermon at the camp service
this morning. I enjoyed the
service very much because the padre
(thought he wasn't a very inspiring
man) said and discussed some of
my most intimate thoughts which,
obviously from what I have
written upto now, hinge on the
above verse. It is certain that I'm
trying to live up to it, though with
not a great degree of success. This
padre also mentioned the prayer
of an Edinburgh weaver which
is probably my prayer above
all others at times like these.
"O God, I pray that I may
have a high opinion of myself."
