... to me is the writing of a diary.
I must keep it up at all costs
when we get back to a bit more
ordered and civilised life. It is
difficult to do this sometimes when
there is plenty to occupy the mind.
Have read some of the Bible recently
- St. John's gospel + part of the
Acts. It is all much more
familiar than I thought. I can
perceive a difference between the
two books I've read, whether it
is due to authorship or not I do
not know, but I'll try to explain.
The gospel appears to be a straightforward
account of Christ's teachings and his
life, but into the Acts there appear
new words + the impression is given
that the author is much more
inflamed than St. John (ie. if it
<u>was</u> he who wrote the gospel).
The service tonight was conducted
by a different man from the one I heard
last week. This one is a man called
Haight. He is a very clear spoken man
with an "eagle face" and is a good
preacher.
