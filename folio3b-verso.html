... in a parcel from the Red Cross.
Anyway it will be great to get
somewhere where we shall have
plenty of soap, water, a decent
suit of clothes + a filled stomach.
Tonight is a "hot meal" night
again + we look forward to the
pint of rice and peas. Today we
had English corned beef - a very
pleasant change though there was
only 3ozs per man (1 tin for 4).
Rations come in the evening now.
The night before last the brad was
still hot when we got it - and
terribly tempting! Every other night
we have a concert in the camp
- chiefly popular songs + comedian
stuff - plenty of slopping singing &
dirty jokes. However, we have a
quite good baritone who is very
popular especially with "<span class="tooltip">Glorious

<span class="tooltip">Jerusalem<span class="tooltip-text">"And did those feet in ancient time" is a poem by William Blake, first printed c.1808.

The band consists of piano -
accordion, guitars + trumpet and
