... consciously in my brain.
Firstly, I have always been troubled to
a certain degree (though previously
I haven't given it a great deal of
thought) about the word "Love" in
such expressions as Love thy
neighbour + in the School Hymn
from which I quoted (v.s. Aug. 4)
I've decided at the moment at any
rate to translate it as "be unselfish
towards", this probably because on
reflection it has struck me how
selfish these last few pages have
been. Secondly, laziness. I haven't
given the matter a deal of
thought lately because it is not
directly connected with any of
the texts or matters which I
remember + like to work on.
However, it is associated
largely with honour and self-control
and I suppose should be
considered together with these.
