â‘¢ <span class="date">Friday, July 31<sup>st</sup></span> As I wrote yesterday
self-control so far as eating my rations
is concerned seems largely to rest on the
frame of mind into which I put
myself previously. Really hard concentration
is necessary before I can
clearly picture in my mind what
I am trying to promise myself to do
However, yesterday and today have
been very good indeed in this
respect. Yesterday afternoon boredom
got its first real grip on me since
we've been here & life felt very
irksome for an hour or so. I had a
wash & combed my hair & felt
a new man after it.
Six groups of 50 moved out from here
last night. I hope it is the
start of the clearance of these camps.
If there is no chance of recapture
the sooner we get to Italy & better
conditions and food the better.
It is generally believed that when
we get to our destination we shall
be issues with battledress, toilet
requisites & a bar of chocolate ...
