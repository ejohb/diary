Last night I felt a bit of a cur. A chap asked me to swap groups with him so that he could be with his pal.
I did so but I'm sorry to say it was the promise of a few cigarettes which decided me at first.
This is very regrettable and all the evening I felt not myself but someone strange.
This morning I felt more like myself again especially with a drink of hot coffee (such as it is).
I'm now in a group completely on my own and don't know whether I'm going to like it.
This whole of this camp is moving into the pen from which we have just come today + Group 10 are supposed to embarking tomorrow.
