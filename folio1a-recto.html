It has been 4 weeks (tomorrow night) since we were captured and the time has certainly flown.
4 weeks of idleness and just the bare necessities to ensure that we do live.
It seems quite hard to believe that we have lived on a tin of boiled beef & a small loaf a day since we came here to Benghazi.
The food we had at Tobruk was certainly very varied. We got our own food there - oatmeal, biscuits, corned beef, tinned sweetcorn  and other vegetables and even tea which tasted like heavenly nectar!
I think we probably felt more hungry there though, after the three days with nothing but a big Italian biscuit, a packet of our own biscuits and half a tin of the Italian boiled beef.

I think Derna was the best camp we've been in so far.
For the few days we were there we had as much water as we liked and at least one meal.
