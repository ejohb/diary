... had struck me more forcible than
anything else as a thought that I
must take back to civil life with
me. I know now that it is like
to be poor and hungry and realise
that wealth can buy not only that
which would prevent hunger but
luxuries. I'm glad to say, though,
that my meals seem to fill me
more nowadays, though even with
my stomach feeling full I still feel
hungry "in my mouth" (which
waters terribly).
<br/><span class="date">Thursday, September 20<sup>th</sup></span> Had "that exhausted
feeling" again yesterday and spent a good
deal of time lying down in the tent.
Went to a lecture on Merino Flock
Farming by a South African farmer. It
was principally for S.A. farmers being
quite technical but it was generally
interesting and gave us an insight
into other people's problems and methods.
This morning's service by Padre Rogers
was very direct - He told us in his
sermon how we should be using this
experience and of the terrific value
of it, how it is a change extremely
rare in modern life.
Yesterday the padre gave me a
small copy of the New Testament.
