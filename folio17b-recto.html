... himself, even as He himself is
pure." I'm inclined though
to think of this verse, and
then sit back and do nothing
about it.
My general condition of unfitness
and laziness has made me
neglect my prayers lately.
I've had a relapse back to my
selfishness & temper (not a very
serious one, but sufficient to be
very troublesome) I must be
careful, as well, not to let
unselfishness and charity take
the form of merely not grabbing
things for myself, for
instance, when we have to
share rations just sitting back
and letting the other fellow
take the bigger piece.
Have been thinking a good
deal about hobbies lately. Stamp
collecting and then photography
seem very attractive to me
now.
