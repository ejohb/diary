... this savours a little too much of
avoiding the issue and I must talk
it over with other people.
I had an enjoyable game of chess
the other day with George's friend John
Robins of Colchester. I was looking at
a copy of the <span class="tooltip">New Testament in
Modern Language<span class="tooltip-text">A translation of the New Testament, based on the text of The Resultant Greek Testament, into nineteenth century English by Richard Francis Weymouth.</span></span> which George had.
I don't remember having heard of it
before, though Weymouth's New Testament
seems to be quite famous. I have
decided to get one when I get back to
civilisation. Yesterday Rogers' sermon was
almost identially along the lines of
some of my own thinking. His papers,
sermons and ideas have tallied with
mine amazingly since I have known
him. I have taken to going to his
Bible study group every other day and
I'm certainly getting quite an insight
into the Act of Apostles, which we have
been studying. Padre Haight who
took the evening service yesterday
seems to be much more "high church"
and load great stress on worship
and adoration of God. This puzzles ...
