... and this was through greed & not hunger (which latter was the cause the night before).
Today I feel that I'm going to do better and shall eat half a tin of bully beef at mid-day (we are having the Italian stuff again) and half in the evening with half a loaf of bread.
A handful of prisoners came in last night including a pilot officer who was in England last Thursday!
His news is that the fighting in N. Africa is now between Matruh and Alamein, that Sevastopol and Rostov are still in Russian hands, that there is a kind of truce between the Italians and British over getting away their prisoners and that "something fishy" is going on in England with American troops (we must translate this how we wish I suppose).
I should think his information is fairly reliable and as such is cheerful.
