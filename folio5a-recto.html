However, it's obvious that they are attempting to keep their minds occupied and fairly alert with general knowledge questions etc.
A different spirit seems to exist among them from that among our own chaps.
They seem more intimate, quarreling - which, unfortunately, is not infrequently, as brothers might.
There is more of that "you-are-not-a-member-of-my-family-&-so-I-must-treat-you-with-a-rather-distant-politeness" which is certainly present to a degree in our own tent - even in our regiment.
They also (to use the army term) "muck in" better than we do i.e. they agree over the best times and arrangements for meals and do things communally ...
