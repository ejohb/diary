â‘® ... <span class="control">WORD</span>. This is very tiresome
but reading does pass the time &
exercise the mind.
<span class="date">Sunday, August 23<sup>rd</sup></span> Have felt
more active and less lazy today.
Hope I can keep it up. Had a
shower first thing, arrived at the
service just in time for the sermon.
The themse of this was the value of <span class="control">WORD</span>
<span class="control">WORD</span> present experience to us. No
doubt of course, it is immensely
valuable from the spiritual (from want
of a better word) point of view. The
chaplain mentioned quite a number
of tings the value of which we have
not before realised or have taken for
granted, e.g. Thought, Books, the Bible,
Friendships, Home. The first three I've
realised positively (lately at any rate)
though having them & the last two
negatively through missing them.
Have been reading a book called "<span class="tooltip">the
Setons<span class="tooltip-text">Depicts Scottish country life in the early 20th century, as young Elizabeth Seton uses her strength of character to keep the household together following her mother's death.</span></span>" which rather brought me down
to earth and made me think a
little about "class". It dwelt plenty
on food! The niceness of tea at home on a dull November day way
mentioned. What a thought!
