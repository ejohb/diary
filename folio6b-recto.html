Today's concert was in the afternoon and I didn't stay long as with very short hair and no hat I don't like standing for too long in the sun.
Apparently it is the last we shall have in this camp which put the chaps in very good spirits.
I certainly hope it is right - that is the impression that we move tomorrow or the day after.
I was surprised to hear the lusty singing of the National Anthem anyway.

I did not write very much yesterday as I felt rather "low".
I was a bit discouraged because I had had a bad day over the rations again, finding it impossible to resist eating all of my loaf as soon as I got it last night.
