... who they call Butch. It
makes a very pleasant break
in the day + something to look
forward to.
Today I've been  looking at a
copy of <span class="tooltip">VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter<span
        class="tooltip-text">The newspaper of the Nazi Party</span></span> for
July 6. I could not make much
headway with the German but the
headline for the Libyan war was
to the effect that the Axis forces had
advanced 540 km in 11 days. There
was a small map too which I
copied showing El Hamein about whose
exact position I've often wondered.
Some Australian prisoners came
in tonight and their news (which
I've heard second-hand and therefore
is to be regarded with suspicion)
is that we have advanced a
few miles from <span class="control">WORD</span> and
captured several thousand
prisoners. They, i.e. the prisoners, were captured, I
hear, 3 or 4 days ago.
It looks as though we shan't
get one hot meal after all which ...
