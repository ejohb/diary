<span class="date">Later</span> Writing this has proved such a
pleasant relaxation that rather than
lie down and do nothing I've
resumed this afternoon despite the fact
that I've very little paper. Our group
actually won in the raffle for the
cheese this time. We each had a very
small portion but it did taste really

crystals (or so it seemed) in it. What

tiny quantities. But most important
I had a shower! Cold water and
a hasty rub with borrowed, poor
quality soap, but really delightful
nevertheless. I must try and swap
some cigarettes for soap and wash
my clothes which I've been wearing
for about five or six weeks now
without a change.
